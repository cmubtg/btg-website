  - I was a bioinformatician for the Chan Lab at the University of Pittsburgh
  School of Medicine from August 2019 to June 2021. I was responsible for taking
  in large amounts of genomic data and analyzing this data to find ways to treat
  pulmonary hypertension. I did this by creating networks of genes based on
  their interactions and running algorithms on this network to find drug
  combinations that treat pulmonary hypertension. To improve the robustness of
  the networks I analyzed, I created a machine learning model that changed path
  lengths' weights to optimize the network. After running this analysis, I found
  189 novel drug combination therapies for the disease. I presented these
  findings to the entire lab, and research has continued to find in-vitro
  evidence to support my in-silico conclusions. 

  - I worked as a full stack developer for Upper Saint Clair High School from February 2018 to August 2021. I designed and implemented the Upper Saint Clair High School Program of Studies website (https://programofstudies.uscsd.k12.pa.us) using Django as a backend and Vue as a frontend. The site replaced a bulky 250 page PDF, and the Vue frontend allowed students to quickly explore classes using filters. In addition, the Django backend provides teachers with an easy and secure way to add classes to the database. I collaborated with the principal and guidance counselors to obtain class data and presented the website to school board members before deploying it to the official school domain. Currently, the website services more than 1500 students a year in choosing their classes.

  - As the Lead Software Developer for the CMU Business Technology Group, I created this website! The website serves as the club website, introducing viewers to what the club does, who the members are, and what projects we are currently working on. Using Gatsby and Netlify CMS, we implemented functionality to allow members to add a portfolio that would be linked to the site. In addition, I was responsible for creating the dynamic members page, home page, and alumni page.  

  - As a member on the avionics team on Carnegie Mellon Rocket Command, I programmed the onboard Raspberry Pi using Python to monitor avionics data such as temperature, altitude, pressure, velocity, and acceleration as well as control servos to adjust the trajectory of our rocket. Currently, we are creating a computer vision model in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi camera to allow the rocket to detect trees and bodies of water and avoid them.

description: I am a first-year student in the School of Computer Science
  majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. While I don't know
  what field I want to work in, I have experience in a wide range of CS
  disciplines such as Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Full Stack Web
  Development, and Software Development. In my free time, I enjoy cooking,
  skateboarding, and hanging out with friends.
