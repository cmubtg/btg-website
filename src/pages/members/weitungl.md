description: I am a junior studying Information systems and Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in building user-focused solutions by employing the human-centered design process. I am also passionate about improving accessibility of current and emerging technologies. I am currently a student researcher at CMU's HCII, working on building a simulator that helps test the share-ride app for autonomous vehicles and designing mobile and website screens for a public ledger platform. In my free time, I like to read, play piano, go scuba diving, and cook Chinese food!
