description: I am a sophmore studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a
  minor in Computer Science. I am not sure exactly what field of software
  engineering I intend to pursue and am very interested in exploring a wide
  breadth of options. I have experience in front and back end web dev as well as
  working with databases. My hobbies include skateboarding, designing clothing,
  and meeting new people.

  * I worked with a team of 9 Engineers and Designers to build out a BTG website
  as well as a Women in Business Website with Gatsby and Netlify CMS. In
  addition to building out parts of the website, I automated the entry of member
  data, porting it directly from forms to the website.
