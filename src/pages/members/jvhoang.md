  * I worked with a team of 9 Engineers and Designers to build out a BTG website
  as well as a Women in Business Website with Gatsby and Netlify CMS. In
  addition to building out parts of the website, I automated the entry of member
  data, porting it directly from forms to the website.

  * I worked as a Summer Intern for Sagetap, a startup in San Francisco. I created a panel that ran sentiment analysis on call transcripts to provide structure for a large database of products discussed over thousands of calls.

  * Iï»¿ built java based arcade games including Galaga and Tetris.

  * I have done various individual hardware projects.
