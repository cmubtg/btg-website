description: HI, I'm Daniel! I'm a freshman at CMU studying Information Systems with minors in Computer Science and Business Administration. I've always been interested in technology, specifically ways that it can be used to interact with people and fulfill their daily objectives. This is why I want to learn more about the intersection between business and computer science. In my free time, I like to play chess, cook, and do logic puzzles.
