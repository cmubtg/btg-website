role: Head of Outreach
description: I am a sophomore in Tepper majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance, and am currently pursuing an additional major in Computer Science. The bridge between the quantitative and the qualitative sides of business intrigue me, especially those behind-the-scenes processes - I look forward to expanding my interests in both these fields in the future. Given these interests, I see myself working in Finance, applying technical and analytical skills in a meaningful, real-world manner. In my spare time, you can find me playing basketball or golf, on the piano, taking landscape photos, or skiing on the slopes in Whistler.
