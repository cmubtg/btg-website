  * I helped build an app for the CMU varsity golf team using R and Leaflet. The resulting application allows golfers to click on a map to place their golf shots and submit them to reveal analytics regarding their performance.
  * I worked with two others to create a crowdsourcing pet-finding app on iOS for my mobile application development. We called it "Pawst n Found".
  * I collaborated with Wesley Family Services, a Pittsburgh non-profit, and helped revamp their database management system using c# on dotnet core.
  * I assisted another designer in developing a website for a researcher at CMU to display his ClearTerms project, a project about the trustworthiness of terms and condition statements.
name: Raymond Li
role: Head of Operations
description: I am a senior in the Information Systems program with an additional major in Statistics. The information systems major is the intersection between business and technology, which prompted my interest in BTG. Dabbling a little in many areas such as consulting, data science, machine learning, and more has led me to ultimately pursue software upon graduation. Professional life aside, I have been a hopeless New York Knicks fan for over ten years and have participated in various club/intramural sports at CMU. I also really enjoy watching CMU's dancers' symposium every semester.
