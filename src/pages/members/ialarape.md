description: I am a sophomore in Dietrich college, majoring in Information Systems with intended minors in LTI and Software Engineering. I am deeply curious about language and computing and the infinite possibilities that lie at their intersection. 

In my free time, I enjoy practicing the guitar and piano, playing soccer/basketball with friends and taking pictures.
