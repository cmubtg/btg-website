description: I am currently a freshman majoring in Business and Statistics/Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. I came to CMU with the intent of pursuing projects and courses at the intersection of advanced technology, business, and sustainability which is also why I joined the Business Technology Group. I hope to apply the knowledge and skills I learn to future work in artificial intelligence and consulting. Outside of CMU, I enjoy reading, working out, and watching bad movies!
