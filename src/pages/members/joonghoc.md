description: I am a junior in Dietrich College majoring in Statistics & Machine Learning with two additional minors in human computer interaction and business analytics & optimisation. I am also one of CMU’s Quantitative Social Science Scholars.  I am very excited for the upcoming tides that will turn society around. Through my experience in consulting, SWE, DS, DE and ML, I aspire to be in the front line as a machine learning engineer and watch our technology restructure the crux of the  the society we know today.
