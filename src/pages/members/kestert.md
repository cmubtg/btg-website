description: I'm a freshman studying Information Systems. Since young, I've loved solving problems. From championing a cause to dispel misconceptions about Parkinsonâ€™s disease to piecing together puzzles at home, I constantly look for new challenges and problems to solve. This insatiable thirst for problem-solving led me to the world of tech, startups, and computer science. In my spare time, I read books about tech and controversial issues and continue to pick up new skills in programming. I'm also a firm believer in the power of tech in improving and transforming the lives of others around the world.
