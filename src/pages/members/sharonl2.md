  * I am currently one of the Publicity co-chairs for Society of Women Engineers
  where I design content for Carnegie Mellon’s SWE Chapter’s Instagram,
  Facebook, and LinkedIn pages to advertise chapter events.

  * I recreated and programmed a popular cooking game, *Overcooked*, in Python along with additional features such as a functional opponent AI and multiplayer mode under a timeframe of less than 1 week for my 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science term project.

  * I built and coded a color-to-movement-to-position double transducer composed of a color sensor, linear actuator, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, I2C LCD display, and Arduino Uno where input signals are converted throughout different domains to output an angular position. 

  * I worked in a group of three to develop a mechanism for a client with a disability to which we designed and constructed a personal assistive musical instrument that sends MIDI signals using an Arduino Micro and Fusion 360 to create music digitally based on different inputs dependent on foot movements such as a roller and foot pedals. 

  * I programmed an Android pedometer app using Processing by applying signal processing to accelerometer data read from an Android device and check if it passed through a threshold using peak-to-peak detection in the waveform in order to count steps accurately independent of phone orientation

  * I built a simple gesture detector using the Particle Argon and the Qwiic based accelerometer by coding micro-controller code, interface with a sensor, and stream data over a serial port and sent gestures to the Particle cloud. I detected different gestures such as a line, square, triangle, and circle while showing visual notification as well as the detection of letters of the alphabet.
