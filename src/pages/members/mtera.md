  * I am a research assistant for an HCI lab looking into autonomous vehicles
  and their future impacts on public transit. As a research assistant I perform
  qualitative analysis on the transformation of transit work as autonomous
  vehicle technology is applied to the complex environments of public transit.

  * In my freshman year, I took part in an AI Motion Fingerprint project. I created an AI model that is capable of recognizing a person based on their walk using a phones’ IMU sensor or smartwatch. 

  * I was a Business Technology Analyst Intern at Dadel, which is a start-up company that focuses on creating a personal data exchange platform. 

  * I was a web developer for Re:Bloom, where I created an easy to maintain website for a start-up company.

description: I am currently a junior majoring in Information Systems and
  pursuing a minor in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I picked this
  course of study because I strongly believe that the integration of computer
  science and business management has the potential to change how companies work
  in the digitized world. I was a Data Scientist Intern at Meta for the Summer
  of 2022. Some of my hobbies include working out, baking, traveling, and
  hiking.
