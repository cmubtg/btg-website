  * I am a research assistant for an HCI lab looking into autonomous vehicles and their future impacts on public transit. As a research assistant I perform qualitative analysis on the transformation of transit work as autonomous vehicle technology is applied to the complex environments of public transit.
  * In my freshman year, I took part in an AI Motion Fingerprint project. I created an AI model that is capable of recognizing a person based on their walk using a phonesâ€™ IMU sensor or smartwatch. 
  * I was a Business Technology Analyst Intern at Dadel, which is a start-up company that focuses on creating a personal data exchange platform. 
  * I was a web developer for Re:Bloom, where I created an easy to maintain website for a start-up company.

description: I am currently a sophomore majoring in Information Systems and pursuing a minor in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I picked this course of study because I strongly believe that the integration of computer science and business management has the potential to change how companies work in the digitized world. I am an incoming Data Scientist Intern at Meta for the Summer of 2022. Some of my hobbies include working out, baking, traveling, and hiking.
