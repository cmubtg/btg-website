name: David You
role: Head of Product
description: I am a senior in Tepper majoring in Business Administration with an
  additional major in  Computer Science. I am very interested in the
  intersection of business and technology, and I hope to combine these interests
  as a product manager. I am particularly interested in medical technologies and
  educational technologies. I enjoy teaching technical material and I've worked
  as a teaching assistant for two different computer science classes. In my free
  time, I enjoy going to the gym, reading about new technical innovations, and
  cooking.
