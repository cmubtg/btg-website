description: I am a junior in Tepper majoring in Business Administration with an additional major in  Computer Science. I am very interested in the intersection of business and technology, and I hope to combine these interests as a product manager. I am particularly interested in medical technologies and educational technologies. I enjoy teaching technical material and I've worked as a teaching assistant for two different computer science classes. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, reading about new technical innovations, and cooking.
