role: Business Analyst
description: Hello! My name is Eunice Yang. I am a sophomore majoring in Business with an intended double major in Stat and ML. I applied as a business analyst because I believe that data can create useful implications in a variety of settings, from determining the most influential factor for a dress sale to identifying the population who most likely cannot afford housing. I hope to use my data analytical skills to create a project that makes a positive impact with my bright teammates at BTG. In my free time, I like working out, singing, and watching movies.
