description: I am a sophomore in CIT studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My interests include software engineering, cybersecurity, and IOT. I am especially interested in the product design process, and I am looking forward to learning more through Product Management Academy this semester. I greatly enjoy teamwork and try to involve myself in opportunities in which I can collaborate with other passionate students around me. Outside of school, I enjoy participating in ballroom dance, playing ultimate frisbee, and trying new recipes.
