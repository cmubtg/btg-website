description: Hey there! I'm Ethan, a Singaporean undergraduate student at CMU. I am deeply interested in the many ways that we can harness the power of technology to transform businesses in terms of product design and more! In my free time, I enjoy watching motorsport racing and football and spend my downtime reading more about the intersection between entrepreneurship and tech. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to chat about any overlapping interests!
