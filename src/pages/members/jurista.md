description: Howdy! I am a sophomore in Information Systems with a minor in Media Design. I'm interested in how humans interact with technology and how we can use their information to advance personability, efficiency, and sustainability in many systems and products. I enjoy exploring the city, trying new restaurants, and hanging out with friends in my free time.
