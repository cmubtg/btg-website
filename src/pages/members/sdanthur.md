description: I am a freshman studying Business Administration. I grew up in the
  suburbs of Chicago and have lived there my entire life. I have always been
  interested in both business and technology and am still figuring out how I can
  combine both of those fields. I have also always had a passion for politics
  and government and have worked/volunteered for many campaigns over the last
  few years. In my free time, I love playing music, watching football with my
  family, and spending time with friends!

  * I interned at and attended LaunchX, an entrepreneurial bootcamp, where I
  started a company called Stera which added fitness to gaming. I conducted
  market research, created a business plan, helped with the development of the
  app and website, and pitched to investors. 

  * I created a single-player typing game using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite which scraped text files, had interactive features, and give analytical feedback.
