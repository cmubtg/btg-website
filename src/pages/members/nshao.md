  * I worked for two summers at Microsoft in Azure Data, where I created a more effective solution for users to migrate from on premises SQL Server DBs to Azure DB's, as well as improved database migration speeds for PostgreSQL database using different parallelization strategies with Azure Data Factory.
  * I built a new and improved CMU office hours queue to tackle pain points of TAs when dealing with queue issues and finding analytics for their courses.
  * I designed and created a Discord bot to manage a discord server where CMU students can find peers who are looking to trade meal blocks with a GCE VM and MongoDB.
name: Nathan Shao
role: Product Manager
description: I am a Senior from Seattle, WA studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. I have spent the last few months looking for projects where I could choose, design, and build a product I have passion for from scratch. During my last semester, I am working on becoming a more effective and independent IC by finding opportunities to improve my soft skills, as well learning to self-manage projects that I am interested in. Post graduation, I will be working full time as a Software Engineer for Anduril Industries. In my free time, I listen to a lot of music (chill EDM, indie pop, alternative, everything really), read psychology/human behavior or sci-fi books, and watch youtube tutorials on things I might never touch in my life.
