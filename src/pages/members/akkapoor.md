  * - I created a ChessAI in python from scratch with multiple difficulty levels, as well as a multiplayer mode. The Chess AI was created using the minimax algorithm and the optimal moves are determined by board analysis heuristics that I developed myself.
  * - I got 3rd place in the Hack112 Hackathon in Spring 2022 for a waterpong game that tracks your hands motion through 2 cameras to determine velocity and direction and then display it with 3d graphics (used vpython and OpenCV)
  * - I interned at SVB Capital on the data science team that was working on developing a Projections app which would analyze all of their data on previous investments in order to make accurate predictions on current/new investments. Helped develop the backend in python.
  * - I am the President of CMU Surf Club which is an sports/recreation club where we plan trips to New Jersey to surf every few weeks, along with hosting water sports activities in Pittsburgh.

description: I am a sophomore in Business Administration pursuing Computer Science as a minor. I am really fascinated by the intersection of business and computer science and hope to use these skills to be a well-rounded software engineer and potentially go into product management and entrepreneurship in the future. I am especially passionate about working in climate technology and artificial intelligence. In my free time I enjoy surfing when I'm back in California, working out, photography, and rock climbing. In general I love the outdoors.
