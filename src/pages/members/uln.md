description: I am a graduate student at Heinz studying Information Systems Management. I have a background in software development and cross-functional collaboration. Throughout my professional and academic journey, I have worked on several initiatives that involved closely working with non-technical users, identifying their problems, and designing solutions. Being able to bridge the gap between business and technology is my strong suit. In my leisure time, I like to go hiking, mountain biking, and play the ukulele.
