description: "I am a senior studying Business with concentrations in Technology
  and Analytics. I'm interested in Business and Technology and, more
  specifically, how we can leverage technological advancements in areas like
  machine learning to help drive data-based decision-making. In my free time, I
  love playing strategy-based games and watching T.V. shows and movies with a
  strong mystery element. I guess you could say problem-solving is a passion of
  mine. "
