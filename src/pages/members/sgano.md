description: I am currently a freshman majoring in Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m hoping to build upon my background in social entrepreneurship and data science as a proactive, positive, and collaborative business analyst in Business Technology Group. In my free time, I enjoy singing in an a cappella group, playing soccer and hiking, and exploring the city with friends.
