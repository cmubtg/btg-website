description: Hello everyone! My name is Emma Im, and I am currently a freshmen in CMU College of Fine Arts studying Visual Arts. Although I am a traditional medium-based artist most of the time, I also tend to explore around what I can do digitally. Recently I am attracted to HTML/CSS/JS, UI/UX design, adobe programs and more. This is my first time stepping into the field of business, and I'm very excited to see what I can do as a UI/UX designer. In my free time, I enjoy playing pretty much every game there is, working out, and spending time with my friends.
