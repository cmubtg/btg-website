  I am a senior in Tepper studying Business Technology. I am particularly
  interested in product management and driving project success within the
  technology sphere. On top of that, I love exploring entrepreneurship through
  the lens of venture capital. I am also highly active on campus. I teach a
  course in project management methodologies, initiated Product Studio and
  Product Management Academy, and host mahjong nights. In my leisure time, I
  enjoy kayaking, volunteering, scrolling through Redfin, and of course,
  mahjong.
