description: I am a sophomore studying Information Systems with minors in
  Business Administration and Computer Science. I am passionate about using
  technology to create solutions that can benefit the community around me, which
  led me to join the Business Technology Group at CMU. So, I seek to work in the
  consulting, project management, or software development field in the future
  and hope to use my skills and experiences to continue making a positive impact
  in my community. In my free time, I love to travel and explore new places and
  meet people from various cultures. I also enjoy playing piano and working out.
