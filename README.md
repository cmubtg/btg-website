# CMU Business Technology Group Club Website

[CMUBTG's static site](https://www.cmubtg.com/) was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org). It was taken from the [Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms). The site follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

The original version of the site has now been archived [here](https://github.com/cmubtg/cmubtg-website). A huge thanks to [Eric Cheng](https://github.com/eh8) for the initial version of the site.
