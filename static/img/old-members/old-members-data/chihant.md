name: Joanne Tsai
role: Software Developer
description: I am a junior majoring in Information Systems and double minoring in human-computer interaction and business analytics and optimization. I am very interested in the intersection of UX/UI, information technology, and software development, hoping to design and build user-centered technologies. My previous works were mostly done across the layers of both front and back end and incorporated human-centered design principles within. In my free time, I enjoy making playlists, cooking, and exploring local cafes!
