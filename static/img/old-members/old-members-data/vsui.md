description: Hi! I'm Vivian Sui and I am a freshman studying in the Tepper School of Business. I am hoping to pursue a double major in statsML, as I have a strong interest in data science and technology. Specifically, how data science and machine learning can be used to optimize business operations. Outside of academics, I enjoy watching new movies, completing sudoku puzzles, and thrift shopping.
