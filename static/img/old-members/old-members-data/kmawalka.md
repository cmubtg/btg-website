  * I interned at the State of Ohio under a state agency's fiscal division where
  I modeled budget projects with revenues of over $560,000 and $1,120,000
  respectively.

  * I was a hired debate judge at Harvard, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, and Georgetown, which led me to create a social enterprise that interviewed professors at institutions including Harvard, Stanford, and Yale to inform underprivileged debaters.
