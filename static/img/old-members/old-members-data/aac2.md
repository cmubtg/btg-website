description: Hello, I am Anqi, and I am currently a junior at Carnegie Mellon
  University. I am interested in and enjoy making digital projects and designs
  come to life.  My contribution to the project included building frontend pages
  for the app while collaborating with backend developers to retrieve user data
  and discussing UI design changes with the designers. The experience gravitates
  my passion towards UI and front-end.
