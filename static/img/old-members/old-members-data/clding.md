portfolio: |-
  * I oversaw the teaching organization Math and Coding, which services 27 local libraries and 3 community centers, building a curriculum of 9+ courses covering various STEM subjects.
  * I cofounded and led the Artificial Intelligence division of the Public Health club, where I built and trained an autoregression algorithm to monitor and predict on COVID time-series data.
  * I built a PASCAL to MIPS compiler using Java, capable of handling expressions, loops, conditionals, etc...
  * I built a 2-bit counter with loading capabilities designed from a normal Finite State Machine counter (built from AND and OR gates on a breadboard) paired together with a 2-bit mux.

description: I am a freshman majoring in Information Systems with an additional major in Computer Science. My interests lie in the intersection of theory and implementationâ€”how to push the boundaries of innovation and then apply them. Specifically, how Big Data, coupled with advances in computing power, will shape the trajectory of many fields. My hobbies include playing basketball, reading sci-fi novels, and hanging out with friends.
